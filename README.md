# Discretizing-Datasets
GlobalDDS.java implements the three global discretization algorithms:
1. Equal interval width
2. Equal frequency per interval
3. Conditional entropy.

The input to the program should be a text file in LERS format.
The input files need to be inside the project folder

List of files inside \
1. read.me
2. GlobalDDS.java

Instructions to compile/run the program:
1. Navigate to the  project folder on commandline
2. run "javac GlobalDDS.java" to compile the program
3. run "java GlobalDDS" to run the program
3. Enter input file name
4. Choose the discretization algorithm, or press 4 to exit
5. Once program completes, test.ins and test.data files would be generated with the output.
